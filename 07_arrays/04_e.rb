#I think it's 5, because we are look at the index number because of the ()
#I got 3?? that can't be right
#after watching the video now I understand that this looks for the index address of the element inside the ()
#it will return the index of the first time that value shows up
#2. arr.index[5]
# I think this should be 8
#I got an error - after watching the video I understand the syntax is wrong
#3. arr[5]
#is this one 8?
#yes, this one is 8
